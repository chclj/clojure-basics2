# Clojure Basic-Part#2:

This covers basics part#2. 

Have you not attendend the previous session but would like to catch-up? No issues, you can still go through start with our recording https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL48U2zB6krGNIVrdtXACUMCBtnIE0G3al[here] and 
you can practice in the playground from https://github.com/chclj/clojure-basics1[here].

## Usage:

This is designed to be compatible with gitpod, along with required plugins.

You can start the workspace from this https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/chclj/clojure-gitpod[GitPod link]

You'll be required to login/create a free account in gitpod. 

(Please remember, that there is an upper bound for gitpod, so use it wisely.)

## Editor Setup:

Please go through https://github.com/chclj/clojure-basics1/blob/master/editor_intro.md[this] and setup your editor preference.

## Project organization:

- We have individual files for each section in the format of `s<order>_.*clj` under `src/gitpod`.
- We'll go through one by one and go through the contents.
